# RESTful Quiz
#####


## Week 12 Skill Distillery Project 

### Overview 
The primary goal was to create and consume a RESTful API with Java backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend. 
The JavaScript code can be found in Quiz/WebContent (https://github.com/PatGaston3/RESTQuiz/tree/master/RestQuiz/WebContent).

### Languages/Technologies Used
<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Spring Framework</li>
 <ul>
 <li>SpringMVC</li>
 <li>SpringJPA </li>
 <li>bCrypt Password Encoder</li>
 </ul>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Postman</li>
<li>MAMP Pro </li>
<li>XMLHttpRequest</li>
<li>JSON data file manipulation</li>
<li>DOM Manipulation</li>
<li>JQuery</li>
</ul>

### Design
* This quiz game was built with javascript using REST api's to transmit quiz questions and answers from a backend MySQL database.
* Once a user completes their quiz, the scores are persisted back to the backend.
* Features include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.
* When you click on the `take` button of a quiz. A user will start the quiz taking process.
* When a quiz is complete, the user is scored based on correct answers.
* At completions the user's name (entered during testing) will be persisted, along with a score, and will add to the database to be displayed upon reload.

### Challenges

- Consuming the restful API through Spring controllers. 
- Mapping JPA entities to the Database and managing JSON references (in reference to "managed" and "back" references.
