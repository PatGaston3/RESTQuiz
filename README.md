### Design
* This quiz game was built with javascript using REST api's to transmit quiz questions and answers from a backend MySQL database.
* Once a user completes their quiz, the scores are persisted back to the backend.

* Features include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.
  * When you click on the `take` button of a quiz. A user will start the quiz taking process.
  * When a quiz is complete, the user is scored based on correct answers.\
  * At completions the user's name (entered during testing) will be persisted, along with a score, and will add to the database to be displayed upon reload.
